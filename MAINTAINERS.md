# Maintainers

## Cutting a New Release

### 1. Create a release preparation branch from `main`

If necessary, cherry-pick the commits that should be included in the
release. (This should only be done in exceptional circumstances.)

- Update the [`CHANGELOG`], if necessary.

  - By convention, this should be up-to-date as part of the PR process,
    but it ought to be double-checked. (See [below][changelog-refresh]
    for suggestions on how to partially automate this.)

  - Retitle the "Unreleased" section to this release and create a fresh
    "Unreleased" section (see comments in the [`CHANGELOG`] for
    details).

    Don't forget to update the "Full list of changes" links
    appropriately.

> [!TIP]
> Do not wrap bullet points over multiple lines in the `CHANGELOG`.
> GitHub will preserve those line breaks in the Release Notes, which is
> probably not what you want.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Point releases (i.e., not patch releases) should also be given a name,
> taking the form "[ADJECTIVE] [TREE]", incrementing alphabetically from
> the previous release (e.g., "Archetypal Aspen"). Both parts are
> relatively loose, particularly when it comes to botanical correctness,
> and a degree of assonance has become traditional.
>
> The name should be decided amongst the team before release.

- Update the root level `Cargo.toml`.
  - Bump `workspace.package.version`.
  - Bump any workspace dependency versions, respectively.

- Update lockfiles and the release workflow.

  - Run `nix flake update` to update `flake.lock`.

  - Run `cargo update` to update `Cargo.lock`.

  - The release workflow is generated by [`dist`] (formerly
    `cargo-dist`); the version that is currently in use can be found
    in `dist-workspace.toml`. If a newer version exists, then:

    - Download the new version of `dist`.
    - Run `dist init`. This should update the `dist-workspace.toml`
      configuration and the release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)

- Push these changes and wait for green CI and peer approval. Upon both,
  squash and merge the PR into `main`.

### 2. Make the release

- Tag the merged commit in `main` with the release version, prefixed
  with a `v` (e.g., `v0.1.0`). The version number must match the one
  in `Cargo.toml`, otherwise `cargo dist` will fail during CI.

  ```bash
  git tag v0.1.0
  git push --tags
  ```

- Let the `dist` release workflow create a new [draft
  release][releases]. Once this has completed:

  - Verify the draft release.
  - Publish the draft release.

> [!WARNING]
> This step can fail. If it does, delete the new release tag as quickly
> as possible from GitHub and start over:
>
> ```bash
> git push --delete origin vX.Y.Z
> ```

- Update `crates.io`. As of writing, the workspace cannot be published
  automatically, so each package in the workspace needs to be
  individually published in topological order. That is, currently,
  something like:

  ```bash
  cargo publish --package topiary-tree-sitter-facade
  cargo publish --package topiary-web-tree-sitter-sys
  cargo publish --package topiary-core
  cargo publish --package topiary-queries
  cargo publish --package topiary-config
  cargo publish --package topiary-cli
  ```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Publication to `crates.io` requires appropriate access. You may need
> to escalate this appropriately.

> [!TIP]
> `cargo tree --invert` is useful to determine the topology.

### 3. Publicise

> [!WARNING]
> Point releases, only. Don't publicise patch releases, unless there's a
> pressing need to do so (e.g., fix of a security vulnerability, etc.).

- Announce the new version on Tweag's Twitter, Discord and other
  official social network accounts, via someone with access.

- Share amongst other social networks (e.g., Reddit, Hacker News,
  Mastodon, etc.), under personal accounts, at your discretion.

## Generating the PR List for the CHANGELOG

If the unreleased changes in the [`CHANGELOG`] have become stale, the
list of merged PRs can be fetched from:

    https://github.com/tweag/topiary/pulls?q=is:pr+base:main+merged:>YYYY-MM-DD

Replacing `YYYY-MM-DD` by the date of the last release.

If you have the GitHub CLI client, something like the following may be
more convenient:

```bash
gh pr list \
    --limit 500 \
    --base main \
    --state merged \
    --json number,mergedAt,title,body \
| jq \
    --raw-output \
    --argjson release "$(gh release view --json createdAt)" \
    '
        reverse
        | .[]
        | select(.mergedAt > $release.createdAt)
        | ["# PR#\(.number): \(.title)", "*Merged: \(.mergedAt)*", "\(.body)\n"]
        | join("\n\n")
    '
```

> [!TIP]
> The `--limit 500` is an arbitrary "large number" limit of PRs to
> fetch, overriding the low default. As of writing, there's no way to
> set this to "unlimited"; adjust as necessary.
