# Contributing to Topiary

The Topiary team is greatly appreciative of all contributions and will
endeavour to give each the attention it deserves. [Issues](https://github.com/topiary/topiary/issues),
[pull requests](https://github.com/topiary/topiary/pulls) and
[discussions](https://github.com/topiary/topiary/discussions) are all
welcome. If you have any immediate questions, or just want to hang out,
feel free to say "Hi!" on our [Discord channel][discord].

## For language formatter authors

The most effective way of contributing to Topiary is by developing
formatting queries for a language you are interested or invested in that
is not currently supported by Topiary.

The other guides in this section outline the steps needed to bootstrap
this process:

- [Adding a new language](adding-a-new-language.md)
- [Suggested query development workflow](suggested-workflow.md)

More thorough, end-to-end tutorials are also available:

- [Writing a formatter has never been so easy: a Topiary
  tutorial](yann-tutorial.md)

The section below, [for developers](#for-developers), may also be useful
to this end.

### Maturity policy

As described in [Language support](../reference/language-support.md),
formatting queries for languages come in two levels of maturity:
supported and experimental. Cargo feature flags are used to distinguish
these.

Formatting queries from external contributors are also subject to these
levels. However, the Topiary team will not necessarily be familiar with
the language in question and therefore will not be able to accurately
assess the maturity of contributed formatting queries.

In the (current) absence of automated tools that can quantify grammar
coverage of a set of queries, we leave it to contributors to make this
judgement honestly. This can be done by asking yourself the following
question:

> Would I ask a colleague to format their production code with this?

If the answer is "no", because, say, not enough of the language's
grammar is covered, then these queries fall under "experimental"
support. Even if the answer is "maybe", for whatever reason, err on the
side of "experimental"; bearing in mind that, once merged, the Topiary
team will take a best effort approach to fixing any post-contribution
issues, but won't actively maintain these queries.

## For developers

### Nix devshell

A Nix devshell is available, which includes all development
dependencies, for contributing to Topiary. Enter this shell with:

```sh
nix develop
```

### Performance profiling

You can check performance before or after changes by running `cargo
bench`.

If you have [`flamegraph`](https://github.com/flamegraph-rs/flamegraph)
installed, you can also generate a performance flamegraph with, for
example:

```sh
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=true \
cargo flamegraph -p topiary-cli -- \
  format --language ocaml \
  < topiary-cli/tests/samples/input/ocaml.ml \
  > /dev/null
```

This will produce a `flamegraph.svg` plot.

### Code coverage

<div class="warning">
This section has not been updated since December 2022. It may be
out-dated or invalid.

(See issues [#80](https://github.com/topiary/topiary/issues/80) and
[#894](https://github.com/topiary/topiary/issues/894))
</div>

Code coverage metrics can be generated via LLVM profiling data generated
by the build. These can be created by setting appropriate environment
variables to `cargo test`:

```sh
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 \
RUSTFLAGS='-Cinstrument-coverage' \
LLVM_PROFILE_FILE='cargo-test-%p-%m.profraw' \
cargo test
```

This will build and run the test suite and output
`cargo-test-*-*.profraw` files in the working directory. (Outside of the
Nix devshell, you may need `binutils` installed.)

These files can be used by [`grcov`](https://github.com/mozilla/grcov)
to render a variety of output reports. For example, the following
renders HTML output in `target/coverage/html`:

```sh
grcov \
  --branch \
  --output-type html \
  --source-dir topiary-cli/src \
  --binary-path target/debug/deps \
  --output-path target/coverage/html \
  .
```

<div class="warning">

`grcov` relies on the `llvm-tools-preview` component from `rustup`. For
Nix users, `rustup` can interfere with the Rust toolchain that is
provided by Nix, if you have both installed.

</div>

### Website and web playground

<div class="warning">

The WASM-based web playground is currently _not_ under active
development and has diverged from newer releases of Topiary. It has been
removed from the main Topiary repository and now exists under
[`topiary/playground`](https://github.com/topiary/playground).

</div>

The static assets for the Topiary website and playground (once built)
can be found in the `website` directory. To preview the site, you can
start a local web server. For example:

```sh
python -m http.server --directory website
```

The website should then be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
