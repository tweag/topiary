# Writing a formatter has never been so easy: a Topiary tutorial

[Yann Hamdaoui](https://github.com/yannham) has written a step-by-step
guide on how to write a new formatter for your own language, starting
from zero.

## [Part 1]

[Part 1] introduces Topiary and motivates its use to create a formatter
for a toy language, Yolo. Yann first guides you through the creation of
a Tree-sitter grammar for Yolo, then plugs it into Topiary to write its
formatting queries.

## [Part 2]

[Part 2] continues from where the previous part left off, by exploring
some of the more advanced formatting features of Topiary, which are
useful when handling real-life languages. In particular, it looks at
single-line and multi-line layouts, using the Yolo toy language.
