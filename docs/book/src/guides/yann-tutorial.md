# Writing a formatter has never been so easy: A Topiary tutorial

[Yann Hamdaoui](https://github.com/yannham) has written a step-by-step
guide on how to write a new formatter for your own language, starting
from zero.

## [Part 1]

[Part 1] introduces Topiary and motivates its use to create a formatter
for a toy language, Yolo. Yann first guides you through the creation of
a Tree-sitter grammar for Yolo, then plugs it into Topiary to write its
formatting queries.
