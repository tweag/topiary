# Writing queries
As long as there is a [Tree-sitter grammar][tree-sitter-parsers] defined
for a language, Tree-sitter can parse it and provide a concrete syntax
tree (CST). Tree-sitter will also allow us to run queries against this
tree. We can make use of that to define how a language should be
formatted. Here's an example query:

```scheme
[
  (infix_operator)
  "if"
  ":"
] @append_space
```

This will match any node that the grammar has identified to be an
`infix_operator`, as well as any anonymous node containing `if` or `:`.
The match will be captured with the name `@append_space`. Our formatter
runs through all matches and captures, and when we process any capture
called `@append_space`, we will append a space after the matched node.

The formatter goes through the CST nodes and detects all that are
spanning more than one line. This is interpreted to be an indication
from the programmer who wrote the input that the node in question should
be formatted as multi-line. Any other nodes will be formatted as
single-line. Whenever a query match has inserted a _softline_, it will
be expanded to a newline if the node is multi-line, or to a space or
nothing if the node is single-line, depending on whether
`@append_spaced_softline` or `@append_empty_softline` was used.

Before rendering the output, the formatter will do a number of cleanup
operations, such as reducing consecutive spaces and newlines to one,
trimming spaces at end of lines and leading and trailing blanks lines,
and ordering indenting and newline instructions consistently.

This means that you can for example prepend and append spaces to `if`
and `true`, and we will still output `if true` with just one space
between the words.

## Supported capture instructions

This assumes you are already familiar with the [Tree-sitter query
language][tree-sitter-query].

### A note on anchors
The behaviour of "anchors" can be counterintuitive. Consider, for instance, the
following query:
```scheme
(
  (list_entry) @append_space
  .
)
```
One might assume that this query only matches the final element in the list but
this is not true. Since we did not explicitly march a parent node, the engine
will match on every `list_entry`. After all, the when looking only at the nodes
in the query, the `list_entry` is indeed the last node.

To resolve this issue, match explicitly on the parent node:
```scheme
(list
  (list_entry) @append_space
  .
)
```

Or even implicitly:
```scheme
(_
  (list_entry) @append_space
  .
)
```

Note that a capture is put after the node it is associated with. If you
want to put a space in front of a node, you do it like this:

```scheme
(infix_operator) @prepend_space
```

This, on the other hand, will not work:

```scheme
@append_space (infix_operator)
```

### `@allow_blank_line_before`

The matched nodes will be allowed to have a blank line before them, if
specified in the input. For any other nodes, blank lines will be
removed.

#### Example

```scheme
; Allow comments and type definitions to have a blank line above them
[
  (comment)
  (type_definition)
] @allow_blank_line_before
```

### `@append_delimiter` / `@prepend_delimiter`

The matched nodes will have a delimiter appended to them. The delimiter
must be specified using the predicate `#delimiter!`.

#### Example

```scheme
; Put a semicolon delimiter after field declarations, unless they already have
; one, in which case we do nothing.
(
  (field_declaration) @append_delimiter
  .
  ";"* @do_nothing
  (#delimiter! ";")
)
```

If there is already a semicolon, the `@do_nothing` instruction will be
activated and prevent the other instructions in the query (the
`@append_delimiter`, here) from applying. Otherwise, the `";"*` captures
nothing and in this case the associated instruction (`@do_nothing`) does
not activate.

Note that `@append_delimiter` is the same as `@append_space` when the
delimiter is set to `" "` (i.e., a space).

### `@append_multiline_delimiter` / `@prepend_multiline_delimiter`

The matched nodes will have a multi-line-only delimiter appended to
them. It will be printed only in multi-line nodes, and omitted in
single-line nodes. The delimiter must be specified using the predicate
`#delimiter!`.

#### Example

```scheme
; Add a semicolon at the end of lists only if they are multi-line, to avoid [1; 2; 3;].
(list_expression
  (#delimiter! ";")
  (_) @append_multiline_delimiter
  .
  ";"? @do_nothing
  .
  "]"
  .
)
```

If there is already a semicolon, the `@do_nothing` instruction will be
activated and prevent the other instructions in the query (the
`@append_multiline_delimiter`, here) from applying. Likewise, if the
node is single-line, the delimiter will not be appended either.

### `@append_empty_softline` / `@prepend_empty_softline`

The matched nodes will have an empty softline appended or prepended to
them. This will be expanded to a newline for multi-line nodes and to
nothing for single-line nodes.

#### Example

```scheme
; Put an empty softline before dots, so that in multi-line constructs we start
; new lines for each dot.
(_
  "." @prepend_empty_softline
)
```

### `@append_hardline` / `@prepend_hardline`

The matched nodes will have a newline appended or prepended to them.

#### Example

```scheme
; Consecutive definitions must be separated by line breaks
(
  (value_definition) @append_hardline
  .
  (value_definition)
)
```

### `@append_indent_start` / `@prepend_indent_start`

The matched nodes will trigger indentation before or after them. This
will only apply to lines following, until an indentation end is
signalled. If indentation is started and ended on the same line, nothing
will happen. This is useful, because we get the correct behaviour
whether a node is formatted as single-line or multi-line. It is
important that all indentation starts and ends are balanced.

#### Example

```scheme
; Start an indented block after these
[
  "begin"
  "else"
  "then"
  "{"
] @append_indent_start
```

### `@append_indent_end` / `@prepend_indent_end`

The matched nodes will trigger that indentation ends before or after
them.

#### Example

```scheme
; End the indented block before these
[
  "end"
  "}"
] @prepend_indent_end

; End the indented block after these
[
  (else_clause)
  (then_clause)
] @append_indent_end
```

### `@append_input_softline` / `@prepend_input_softline`

The matched nodes will have an input softline appended or prepended to
them. An input softline is a newline if the node has a newline in front
of it in the input document, otherwise it is a space.

#### Example

```scheme
; Input softlines before and after all comments. This means that the input
; decides if a comment should have line breaks before or after. But don't put a
; softline directly in front of commas or semicolons.

(comment) @prepend_input_softline

(
  (comment) @append_input_softline
  .
  [ "," ";" ]* @do_nothing
)
```

### `@append_space` / `@prepend_space`

The matched nodes will have a space appended or prepended to them. Note
that this is the same as `@append_delimiter` / `@prepend_delimiter`,
with space as delimiter.

#### Example

```scheme
[
  (infix_operator)
  "if"
  ":"
] @append_space
```

### `@append_antispace` / `@prepend_antispace`

It is often the case that tokens need to be juxtaposed with spaces,
except in a few isolated contexts. Rather than writing complicated rules
that enumerate every exception, an "antispace" can be inserted with
`@append_antispace` / `@prepend_antispace`; this will destroy any spaces
(not newlines) from that node, including those added by other formatting
rules.

#### Example

```scheme
[
  ","
  ";"
  ":"
  "."
] @prepend_antispace
```

### `@append_spaced_softline` / `@prepend_spaced_softline`

The matched nodes will have a spaced softline appended or prepended to
them. This will be expanded to a newline for multi-line nodes and to a
space for single-line nodes.

#### Example

```scheme
; Append spaced softlines, unless there is a comment following.
(
  [
    "begin"
    "else"
    "then"
    "->"
    "{"
    ";"
  ] @append_spaced_softline
  .
  (comment)* @do_nothing
)
```

### `@delete`

Remove the matched node from the output.

#### Example

```scheme
; Move semicolon after comments.
(
  ";" @delete
  .
  (comment)+ @append_delimiter
  (#delimiter! ";")
)
```

### `@do_nothing`

If any of the captures in a query match are `@do_nothing`, then the
match will be ignored.

#### Example

```scheme
; Put a semicolon delimiter after field declarations, unless they already have
; one, in which case we do nothing.
(
  (field_declaration) @append_delimiter
  .
  ";"* @do_nothing
  (#delimiter! ";")
)
```

### `@multi_line_indent_all`

To be used on comments or other leaf nodes, to indicate that we should indent
all its lines, not just the first.

#### Example

```scheme
(#language! ocaml)
(comment) @multi_line_indent_all
```

### `@single_line_no_indent`

The matched node will be printed alone, on a single line, with no indentation.

#### Example

```scheme
(#language! ocaml)
; line number directives must be alone on their line, and can't be indented
(line_number_directive) @single_line_no_indent
```

### Understanding the different newline captures

| Type            | Single-Line Context | Multi-Line Context |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :----------------- |
| Hardline        | Newline             | Newline            |
| Empty Softline  | Nothing             | Newline            |
| Spaced Softline | Space               | Newline            |
| Input Softline  | Input-Dependent     | Input-Dependent    |

"Input softlines" are rendered as newlines whenever the targeted node
follows a newline in the input. Otherwise, they are rendered as spaces.

#### Example

Consider the following JSON, which has been hand-formatted to exhibit
every context under which the different newline capture names operate:

```json
{
  "single-line": [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "multi-line": [
    1, 2,
    3
    , 4
  ]
}
```

We'll apply a simplified set of JSON format queries that:
1. Opens (and closes) an indented block for objects;
2. Each key-value pair gets its own line, with the value split onto a
   second;
3. Applies the different newline capture name on array delimiters.

That is, iterating over each `@NEWLINE` type, we apply the following:

```scheme
(#language! json)

(object . "{" @append_hardline @append_indent_start)
(object "}" @prepend_hardline @prepend_indent_end .)
(object (pair) @prepend_hardline)
(pair . _ ":" @append_hardline)

(array "," @NEWLINE)
```

The first two formatting rules are just for clarity's sake. The last
rule is what's important; the results of which are demonstrated below:

##### `@append_hardline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1,
  2,
  3,
  4],
  "multi-line":
  [1,
  2,
  3,
  4]
}
```

##### `@prepend_hardline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1
  ,2
  ,3
  ,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1
  ,2
  ,3
  ,4]
}
```

##### `@append_empty_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1,2,3,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1,
  2,
  3,
  4]
}
```

##### `@prepend_empty_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1,2,3,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1
  ,2
  ,3
  ,4]
}
```

##### `@append_spaced_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "multi-line":
  [1,
  2,
  3,
  4]
}
```

##### `@prepend_spaced_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1 ,2 ,3 ,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1
  ,2
  ,3
  ,4]
}
```

##### `@append_input_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "multi-line":
  [1, 2,
  3, 4]
}
```

##### `@prepend_input_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1 ,2 ,3 ,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1 ,2 ,3
  ,4]
}
```

### Custom scopes and softlines

So far, we've expanded softlines into line breaks depending on whether
the CST node they are associated with is multi-line. Sometimes, CST
nodes define scopes that are either too big or too small for our needs.
For instance, consider this piece of OCaml code:

```ocaml
(1,2,
3)
```

Its CST is the following:

```
{Node parenthesized_expression (0, 0) - (1, 2)} - Named: true
  {Node ( (0, 0) - (0, 1)} - Named: false
  {Node product_expression (0, 1) - (1, 1)} - Named: true
    {Node product_expression (0, 1) - (0, 4)} - Named: true
      {Node number (0, 1) - (0, 2)} - Named: true
      {Node , (0, 2) - (0, 3)} - Named: false
      {Node number (0, 3) - (0, 4)} - Named: true
    {Node , (0, 4) - (0, 5)} - Named: false
    {Node number (1, 0) - (1, 1)} - Named: true
  {Node ) (1, 1) - (1, 2)} - Named: false
```

We would want to add a line break after the first comma, but because the
CST structure is nested, the node containing this comma
(`product_expression (0, 1) - (0, 4)`) is *not* multi-line  Only the
top-level node `product_expression (0, 1) - (1, 1)` is multi-line.

To solve this issue, we introduce user-defined scopes and softlines.

#### `@prepend_begin_scope` / `@append_begin_scope` / `@prepend_end_scope` / `@append_end_scope`

These tags are used to define custom scopes. In conjunction with the `#scope_id!
` predicate, they define scopes that can span multiple CST nodes, or only part
of one. For instance, this scope matches anything between parenthesis in a
`parenthesized_expression`:

```scheme
(parenthesized_expression
  "(" @append_begin_scope
  ")" @prepend_end_scope
  (#scope_id! "tuple")
)
```

#### Scoped softlines

We have four predicates that insert softlines in custom scopes, in
conjunction with the `#scope_id!` predicate:

* `@prepend_empty_scoped_softline`
* `@prepend_spaced_scoped_softline`
* `@append_empty_scoped_softline`
* `@append_spaced_scoped_softline`

When one of these scoped softlines is used, their behaviour depends on
the innermost encompassing scope with the corresponding `scope_id`. If
that scope is multi-line, the softline expands into a line break. In any
other regard, they behave as their non-`scoped` counterparts.

#### Example

This Tree-sitter query:

```scheme
(#language! ocaml)

(parenthesized_expression
  "(" @begin_scope @append_empty_softline @append_indent_start
  ")" @end_scope @prepend_empty_softline @prepend_indent_end
  (#scope_id! "tuple")
)

(product_expression
  "," @append_spaced_scoped_softline
  (#scope_id! "tuple")
)
```

...formats this piece of code:

```ocaml
(1,2,
3)
```

...as:

```ocaml
(
  1,
  2,
  3
)
```

...while the single-lined `(1, 2, 3)` is kept as is.

If we used `@append_spaced_softline` rather than
`@append_spaced_scoped_softline`, the `1,` would be followed by a space rather
than a newline, because it's inside a single-line `product_expression`.

### Testing context with predicates

Sometimes, similarly to what happens with softlines, we want a query to match
only if the context is single-line, or multi-line. Topiary has several
predicates that achieve this result.

### `#single_line_only!` / `#multi_line_only!`

These predicates allow the query to trigger only if the matched nodes are in a
single-line (resp. multi-line) context.

#### Example

```scheme
; Allow (and enforce) the optional "|" before the first match case
; in OCaml if and only if the context is multi-line
(
  "with"
  .
  "|" @delete
  .
  (match_case)
  (#single_line_only!)
)

(
  "with"
  .
  "|"? @do_nothing
  .
  (match_case) @prepend_delimiter
  (#delimiter! "| ")
  (#multi_line_only!)
)
```

### `#single_line_scope_only!` / `#multi_line_scope_only!`

These predicates allow the query to trigger only if the associated custom scope
containing the matched nodes are is single-line (resp. multi-line).

#### Example

```scheme
; Allow (and enforce) the optional "|" before the first match case
; in function expressions in OCaml if and only if the scope is multi-line
(function_expression
  (match_case)? @do_nothing
  .
  "|" @delete
  .
  (match_case)
  (#single_line_scope_only! "function_definition")
)
(function_expression
  "|"? @do_nothing
  .
  (match_case) @prepend_delimiter
  (#multi_line_scope_only! "function_definition")
  (#delimiter! "| ") ; sic
)
```
