Motivate single/multi-line-ness as it's a super important concept

FIXME
The below paragraph was moved from worked example. Incorporate it in
here, somewhere.
----------------------------------------------------------------------->
The formatter goes through the CST nodes and detects all that are
spanning more than one line. This is interpreted to be an indication
from the programmer who wrote the input that the node in question should
be formatted as multi-line. Any other nodes will be formatted as
single-line. Whenever a query match has inserted a _softline_, it will
be expanded to a newline if the node is multi-line, or to a space or
nothing if the node is single-line, depending on whether
`@append_spaced_softline` or `@append_empty_softline` was used.


## `@allow_blank_line_before`

The matched nodes will be allowed to have a blank line before them, if
specified in the input. For any other nodes, blank lines will be
removed.

### Example

```scheme
; Allow comments and type definitions to have a blank line above them
[
  (comment)
  (type_definition)
] @allow_blank_line_before
```

## `@append_empty_softline` / `@prepend_empty_softline`

The matched nodes will have an empty softline appended or prepended to
them. This will be expanded to a newline for multi-line nodes and to
nothing for single-line nodes.

### Example

```scheme
; Put an empty softline before dots, so that in multi-line constructs we start
; new lines for each dot.
(_
  "." @prepend_empty_softline
)
```

## `@append_hardline` / `@prepend_hardline`

The matched nodes will have a newline appended or prepended to them.

### Example

```scheme
; Consecutive definitions must be separated by line breaks
(
  (value_definition) @append_hardline
  .
  (value_definition)
)
```

## `@append_input_softline` / `@prepend_input_softline`

The matched nodes will have an input softline appended or prepended to
them. An input softline is a newline if the node has a newline in front
of it in the input document, otherwise it is a space.

### Example

```scheme
; Input softlines before and after all comments. This means that the input
; decides if a comment should have line breaks before or after. But don't put a
; softline directly in front of commas or semicolons.

(comment) @prepend_input_softline

(
  (comment) @append_input_softline
  .
  [ "," ";" ]* @do_nothing
)
```

## `@append_spaced_softline` / `@prepend_spaced_softline`

The matched nodes will have a spaced softline appended or prepended to
them. This will be expanded to a newline for multi-line nodes and to a
space for single-line nodes.

### Example

```scheme
; Append spaced softlines, unless there is a comment following.
(
  [
    "begin"
    "else"
    "then"
    "->"
    "{"
    ";"
  ] @append_spaced_softline
  .
  (comment)* @do_nothing
)
```

## Understanding the different newline captures

| Type            | Single-Line Context | Multi-Line Context |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :----------------- |
| Hardline        | Newline             | Newline            |
| Empty Softline  | Nothing             | Newline            |
| Spaced Softline | Space               | Newline            |
| Input Softline  | Input-Dependent     | Input-Dependent    |

"Input softlines" are rendered as newlines whenever the targeted node
follows a newline in the input. Otherwise, they are rendered as spaces.

### Example

Consider the following JSON, which has been hand-formatted to exhibit
every context under which the different newline capture names operate:

```json
{
  "single-line": [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "multi-line": [
    1, 2,
    3
    , 4
  ]
}
```

We'll apply a simplified set of JSON format queries that:
1. Opens (and closes) an indented block for objects;
2. Each key-value pair gets its own line, with the value split onto a
   second;
3. Applies the different newline capture name on array delimiters.

That is, iterating over each `@NEWLINE` type, we apply the following:

```scheme
(#language! json)

(object . "{" @append_hardline @append_indent_start)
(object "}" @prepend_hardline @prepend_indent_end .)
(object (pair) @prepend_hardline)
(pair . _ ":" @append_hardline)

(array "," @NEWLINE)
```

The first two formatting rules are just for clarity's sake. The last
rule is what's important; the results of which are demonstrated below:

#### `@append_hardline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1,
  2,
  3,
  4],
  "multi-line":
  [1,
  2,
  3,
  4]
}
```

#### `@prepend_hardline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1
  ,2
  ,3
  ,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1
  ,2
  ,3
  ,4]
}
```

#### `@append_empty_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1,2,3,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1,
  2,
  3,
  4]
}
```

#### `@prepend_empty_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1,2,3,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1
  ,2
  ,3
  ,4]
}
```

#### `@append_spaced_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "multi-line":
  [1,
  2,
  3,
  4]
}
```

#### `@prepend_spaced_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1 ,2 ,3 ,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1
  ,2
  ,3
  ,4]
}
```

#### `@append_input_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1, 2, 3, 4],
  "multi-line":
  [1, 2,
  3, 4]
}
```

#### `@prepend_input_softline`

```json
{
  "single-line":
  [1 ,2 ,3 ,4],
  "multi-line":
  [1 ,2 ,3
  ,4]
}
```

## Testing context with predicates

Sometimes, similarly to what happens with softlines, we want a query to match
only if the context is single-line, or multi-line. Topiary has several
predicates that achieve this result.

### `#single_line_only!` / `#multi_line_only!`

These predicates allow the query to trigger only if the matched nodes are in a
single-line (resp. multi-line) context.

> **Note**\
> There are scoped equivalents to these predicates; please see
> [scopes](scopes.md#testing-context-with-predicates) for details.

#### Example

```scheme
; Allow (and enforce) the optional "|" before the first match case
; in OCaml if and only if the context is multi-line
(
  "with"
  .
  "|" @delete
  .
  (match_case)
  (#single_line_only!)
)

(
  "with"
  .
  "|"? @do_nothing
  .
  (match_case) @prepend_delimiter
  (#delimiter! "| ")
  (#multi_line_only!)
)
```
