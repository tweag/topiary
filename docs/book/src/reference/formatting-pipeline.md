# The formatting pipeline

## Query matching

As discussed in [Tree-sitter and its queries](../getting-started/on-tree-sitter.md),
the essence of Topiary is to apply the formatting queries against an
input. That is, each Tree-sitter query will be applied to the input's
syntax tree, taking into account the relevant capture names against all
matching subtrees. The result of this is effectively serialised into a
list of atomic units -- formatting directives, defined by the matching
capture names, and leaf node content (see also [`@leaf`](capture-names/general.md#leaf))
-- along with the necessary metadata to drive the process.

## Atom processing

The list of atoms from the first step are then processed into a
cleaned-up, canonical form. Specifically:

- Processes [scopes](capture-names/scopes.md);
- Processes [deletions](capture-names/insertion-and-deletion.md#delete);
- Processes [case modifications](capture-names/modification.md#lower_case--upper_case);
- Merges runs of whitespace into a single atom -- or removes them
  entirely, in the presence of an [antispace](capture-names/horizontal-spacing.md#append_antispace--prepend_antispace)
  -- and sorts some remaining, adjacent atoms (e.g., hardlines always
  before spaces, etc.).

> **Note**\
> In the code, this step is referred to as "post-processing"; as in
> "post-query matching-processing", rather than a final step.

## Pretty printing

The pretty printer goes through the processed atom collection and
renders each atom into a stream of text output. For example, an
"indentation start" atom will increase the indent level; that is, all
atoms immediately following a hardline will now be prefixed with the
appropriate indent string, until the respective "indentation end" atom
is reached.

## Vertical whitespace trimming

The output from pretty printing can leave too much or too few vertical
whitespace (at the end of the file).
This final step clears that up.

<div class="warning">

This trimming happens regardless of whether the whitespace was present
in the input, intentionally or otherwise.

</div>

## Idempotence checking

The Topiary CLI performs "[idempotence][wiki:idempotence] checking" by
default. That is, it checks that formatting (i.e., per the pipeline as
described above) an already-formatted input makes no further changes.

Anecdotally, this incurs a negligible performance penalty to Topiary:
its formatting time is dominated by start-up overhead (e.g., parsing the
query files). However, the check can be disabled; this is often useful
while developing or debugging formatting queries.

> See the [usage documentation](../cli/usage/format.md) for `topiary
> format` for details on how this is exposed. The [web
> playground](../playground/web.md) also provides this option.
