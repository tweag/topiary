# Topiary as a Rust library

Topiary is published on [crates.io][topiary-crate], which means that its
documentation can be found on [docs.rs][topiary-docs]. Of main interest
is the `formatter` function that performs the actual formatting. The
example in the documentation of that function is kept up to date.

For a more complete example, see the [client-app example in the Topiary
repository][client-app].
