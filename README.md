Topiary aims to be a uniform formatter for simple languages, as part of
the [Tree-sitter] ecosystem. It is named after the art of clipping or
trimming trees into fantastic shapes.

Topiary is designed for formatter authors and formatter users. Authors
can create a formatter for a language without having to write their own
formatting engine or even their own parser. Users benefit from uniform
code style and, potentially, the convenience of using a single formatter
tool, across multiple languages over their codebases, each with
comparable styles applied.
