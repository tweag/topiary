;; Compound Statements and Subshells

; Compound statements and subshells are formatted in exactly the same
; way. In a multi-line context, their opening parenthesis triggers a new
; line and the start of an indent block; the closing parenthesis
; finishes that block. In a single-line context, spacing is used instead
; of new lines (NOTE that this is a syntactic requirement of compound
; statements, but not of subshells).
;
; NOTE Despite being isomorphic, the queries for compound statements and
; subshells are _not_ generalised, to ensure parentheses balance.

;; Commands

; NOTE "Command" is an epithet for a "unit of execution":
; * Simple commands (e.g., binaries, builtins, functions, etc.)
; * Command lists
; * Command pipelines
; * Compound statements
; * Subshells
; * Redirection statements (NOTE these aren't "units of execution" in
;   their own right, but are treated as such due to how the grammar
;   organises them as parent nodes of such units)
; * Variable assignment (NOTE these aren't "units of execution" at all,
;   but are treated as such to isolate them from their declaration
;   context; see Variables section, below)
;
; That is, per the grammar:
;   [(command) (list) (pipeline) (compound_statement) (subshell) (redirected_statement) (variable_assignment)]

; One command per line in the following contexts:
; * Top-level
; * Multi-line compound statements and subshells
; * In any branch of a conditional
; * In any branch of a switch statement
; * Within loops
; * Multi-line command substitutions
;
; NOTE Because "command" is such a pervasive and general concept, each
; context needs to be individually enumerated to account for exceptions;
; the primary of which being the condition in if statements.

; NOTE The (simple_expansion), for `$foo`, and (expansion), for `${foo}`
; and friends, node types exist. We consider them as leaves (see above).
; However, it would be _really_ nice if we could write a query that
; converts all (simple_expansions) into (expansions). It can almost be
; done with delimiters, but it doesn't quite work :( For example:
;
; (simple_expansion (variable_name) @prepend_delimiter (#delimiter! "{"))
; (simple_expansion (variable_name) @append_delimiter (#delimiter! "}"))
