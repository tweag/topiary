; i.e., Let expressions and record fields

; A let expression looks like:
;
;   let [rec] IDENT = EXPR in EXPR
;
; The binding expression should appear on a new line, indented, if its
; RHS is multi-line (pushing the "in" to an unindented new line).
; Similarly, the result expression (i.e., after the "in") should appear
; on an new line, if that is multi-line. We don't start an indentation
; block for the result expression, to avoid long diagonals in a series
; of let expressions (which is idiomatic).

;
;  let x
;    : TYPE | ANNOT = 1 in x
;
; It also doesn't do the right thing (push the equals sign to a new
; line) if it lives on the same line as the last annotation in the
; input. For example:
;
;   let x
;     : TYPE = 1 in x
;
; These forms are not attested in the Nickel standard library, as of
