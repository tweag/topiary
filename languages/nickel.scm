;; Symbol Definitions
; i.e., Let bindings and record fields

; Create a scope that covers all annotation atoms, if any,
; which are children of the (annot) node, *and* the equal sign. This
; also defines an indentation block.
;
; NOTE This query will only match when annotations are present; thus a
; "bare" signature, with just an equal sign, will not get a softline,
; regardless of context. This behaviour can be changed by quantifying
; the (annot) node with the Kleene star; with the consequence of keeping
; the signature together if it's written on one line (albeit a different
; one to the defined symbol). For example:
;
;   {
;     foo
;       | some | annotations = 1
;   }
;
; The unquantified behaviour is probably a better trade-off, as bare
; signatures are short and so more conducive to a single-line.
;
;   {
;     foo
;       | some
;       | annotations
;       = 1

; Put each annotation and the equals sign on a new line, in a multi-line
