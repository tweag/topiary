;; Comments

; Comments come in two flavours: standalone (i.e., it's the only thing
; on a line, starting at the current indent level); and trailing (i.e.,
; following some other statement on the same line, with a space
; interposed). Bash does not have multi-line comments; they are all
; single-line.
;
; The grammar parses all comments as the (comment) node, which are
; siblings under a common parent.
;
; Formatting Rules:
;
; 1. A comment's contents must not be touched; some (namely the shebang)
;    have a syntactic purpose.
; 2. All comments must end with a new line.
; 3. Comments can be interposed by blank lines, if they exist in the
;    input (i.e., blank lines shouldn't be engineered elsewhere).
; 4. A comment can never change flavour (i.e., standalone to trailing,
;    or vice versa).
; 5. Trailing comments must be interposed by a space (unless they follow
;    a semicolon, but we still insert the space).

; Rule 1: See @leaf rule, above

; Rule 2
(comment) @append_hardline

; Rule 3: See @allow_blank_line_before rule, above.
; FIXME This doesn't quite get us what we want. It's close, but blank
; lines between comments can get consumed.

; Rule 4: We only have to protect against the case of a standalone
; comment, after a statement, being slurped on to that statement's line
; and becoming a trailing comment. That case is satisfied by Rule 5.

; Rule 5

;; Compound Statements and Subshells

; Compound statements and subshells are formatted in exactly the same
; way. In a multi-line context, their opening parenthesis triggers a new
; line and the start of an indent block; the closing parenthesis
; finishes that block. In a single-line context, spacing is used instead
; of new lines (NOTE that this is a syntactic requirement of compound
; statements, but not of subshells).
;
; NOTE Despite being isomorphic, the queries for compound statements and
; subshells are _not_ generalised, to ensure parentheses balance.

;; Commands

; "Command" is an epithet for, broadly speaking, a "unit of execution".
; It is such a pervasive and general concept in Bash that we need to
; take care when considering the context. For example, the condition in
; an if statement or while loop is a command, but we don't want to
; insert a new line in these cases.
;
; In terms of the grammar, the following nodes should be considered
; "commands":
;
; * (command)
;   Simple commands (e.g., binaries, builtins, functions, etc.)
;
; * (list)
;   Command lists (i.e., "commands" sequenced by && and ||)
;
; * (pipeline)
;   Command pipelines (i.e., "commands" sequenced by | and |&)
;
; * (subshell)
;   Subshells (i.e., arbitrary code enclosed within parentheses)
;
; * (compound_statement)
;   Compound statements (i.e., arbitrary code enclosed within
;   curly-parentheses)
;
; * (redirected_statement)
;   IO redirection (NOTE These aren't semantically "units of execution"
;   in their own right, but are treated as such due to how the grammar
;   organises them as parent nodes of such units)
;
; * (variable_assignment)
;   Variable assignment (NOTE These aren't "units of execution" at all,
;   but are treated as such to isolate them from their declaration
;   context; see Variables section, below)

; We care about the line spacing of "commands" that appear in any of the
; following contexts:
;
; * Top-level statements
; * Multi-line compound statements and subshells
; * Any branch of a conditional or case statement
; * Loop bodies
; * Multi-line command substitutions
;
; We address each context individually, as there's no way to isolate the
; exceptional contexts, where no line spacing is required. We use custom
; scopes to detect cases where a "command" is followed by a newline in
; the input, because modifications to the grammar since v0.19.0 no
; longer add anonymous '\n' nodes to the tree.
