;; Bound Expressions
; i.e., Let expressions and record fields

; The default, multi-line behaviour for the RHS of a bound expression is
; for it to start an indentation block on a new line. However, the
; following idiomatic exceptions should not behave in this way:
;
; * Record literals                   { ... }
; * Array literals                    [ ... ]
; * Enum literals                     [| ... |]
; * Parentheticals                    ( ... )
; * Function declarations             fun ... => ...
; * Match statements                  match { ... }
; * Multi-line and symbolic strings   m%"..."% / xxx-s%"..."%
;
; These should remain in-line. Note that this is true for the right-hand side of
; record patterns as well, but patterns aren't terms, so they aren't subject to
; the general multi-line behavior to begin with. In other words, the right-hand
; side of field patterns behave as the exceptions mentioned above, but we don't
; need any special query to do so.

; Unfortunately, this can't be achieved in current Topiary.
;
; In the meantime, we always put the `=` sign a new line, whether in single-line
; or multi-line mode, and always indent the RHS further in presence of

; let foo | Array Number
