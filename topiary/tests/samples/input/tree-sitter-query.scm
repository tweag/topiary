(#language! ocaml)

; This query file is used to format trees produced by two different grammars:
; - the grammar for OCaml interface files `tree_sitter_ocaml::language_ocaml_interface()`
; - the grammar for OCaml implementation files `tree_sitter_ocaml::language_ocaml()`

; On certain cases, some files may correctly parse with both grammars, but produce
; different syntax trees. We want those files to be formatted the same way,
; independently of the grammar used to parse them.

; To ensure this property, we introduce equivalence classes on syntax node types.
; Simply put, if two node types are in the same equivalence class, then they must
; appear in the same queries.

; If you add or modify a query containing a node type in one of the equivalence classes,
; please make sure to add or modify the corresponding queries for all other node types
; in the same equivalence class.

; The equivalence classes are the following:
; - include_module, include_module_type
; - module_path, extended_module_path, module_type_path
; - module_name, module_type_name

; Sometimes we want to indicate that certain parts of our source text should
; not be formatted, but taken as is. We use the leaf capture name to inform the
; tool of this.
